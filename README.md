Welcome to the Java Algorithms Showcase repository! Here, we delve into the fascinating world of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques using Java. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer, a computer science enthusiast, or a curious learner, this repository offers a rich collection of programs that demonstrate the elegance and efficiency of Java-based solutions.

What‚Äôs Inside?
1. Sorting Algorithms
Explore classic sorting algorithms that play a fundamental role in computer science. From the simplicity of bubble sort to the efficiency of quicksort, we‚Äôve got you covered:

Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently sorts arrays.
Quicksort: The workhorse of sorting algorithms, known for its average-case performance.
Bubble Sort: A straightforward but less efficient method for sorting elements.
Insertion Sort: A simple algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
2. Graph Algorithms
Graphs are powerful data structures used to model relationships between entities. Dive into graph algorithms that solve real-world problems:

Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm: Find the minimum spanning tree of a connected graph.
Prim‚Äôs Algorithm: Discover the minimum spanning tree using a greedy approach.
Dijkstra‚Äôs Shortest Path: Compute the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes.
Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Handle negative-weight edges in shortest path calculations.
3. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is all about breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems. Explore dynamic programming techniques:

Knapsack Problem: Optimize resource allocation (e.g., maximizing value while staying within weight constraints).
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Find the longest subsequence shared by two sequences.
Fibonacci Series: Use dynamic programming to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers.
How to Use
Each program is well-documented, complete with explanations, code samples, and usage instructions. Dive into the relevant directories, explore the Java files, and witness the magic of algorithms in action.
